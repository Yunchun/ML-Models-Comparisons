# ML_Models_Comparisons
- a replication of Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil's 2006: An Empirical Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms
- Used Python to clean 6 datasets to create binary classification task for machine learning algorithms
- Evaluated performances of 6 algorithms on datasets using 6 metrics, including accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC
- Conduct two-sampled t-tests to detect the significance of the difference in performance scores of algorithms and identify models with good and bad performances
