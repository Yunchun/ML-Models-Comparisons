# Supervised-ML-Comparisons
- A replication of Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil's 2006: An Empirical Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms
- Evaluated performances of 6 machine learning algorithms (decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, perceptron classifier, KNN, SVM ) on binary classification tasks by 6 metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, area under ROC curve)
- Conducted two-sample t-tests to detect significant differences in their performances and identify good or underperforming models
